# Objective.

1. To be able to web-scrape the website.
    1. Need to scrape this website to scrape all the links of the websites of the schemes.

# Experience

1. Even though it is a old tutorial but I'm still believing it, though.
    1. Since it is a old tutorial I need to learn it level by level.
2. Happy that I confirmed that fact that we can interact with the website.
3. 

# Notes

1. Cannot pass direct path of the exe file 
    1. Just follow the new tutorial
    2. Do this 
    
    ```python
    from selenium import webdriver
    
    cService = webdriver.ChromeService(executable_path='/Users/[...]binaries(117)/chromedriver')
    driver = webdriver.Chrome(service = cService)
    ```
    
2. Objective
    1. To automate the cookie clicker website.
        1. What should the program do.
            1. Visit the website.
            2. find the desired element.
            3. Click on it.
            4. see if any of the thing is available.
                1. if yes then click it.
                    1. But need to see it how to do it, or else I would never get the one below cursor.
            5. 

# Learning

1. I knew that and I happened that I cannot follow the old tutorials without facing any issues.
    1. Like I didn’t knew that I cannot pass direct executatble file path in the webdrive.Chrome(Path)
2. There have been recent updates in selinium and it really sucks because, I cannot find enough resources.
3. The concept of hit and trial and not giving up is so much important and prevalant in coding.
    1. There is no way that I can find that I cannot use selinium and chrome drivers in ipynb file.
    2. don’t know the error but it doesn’t work.
4. Now I can go to a website and get any element and click it
5. I should be able to extract the element.
6. Learned about waiting.
    1. It is important cause what if the website is slower than program, in most case it will be the case.
7. Clicking the link.
8. Do the cookie clicker by your own and then see the video to see the difference.
9. While resting I realised that I have to do dsa as well.
    1. Follow the CP sheet as well for fun though.
    2. And the main dsa sheet for gaining knowledge.
        1. Follow, read and see videos of playlist and all.
        2. But read for sure.
10. Seriously I just need to breakdown more and more and not quit crying.
11. Iam so much confused that some time the same code runs fluently and sometimes it doesn’t work.
12. Done with the project and Iam very much happy with my progress.
13. Learning after seeeing his cookie clicker.
    1. I don’t know many of the fuctions and all.
        1. In this case a basic tutorial will be quite helpful. Or reading articles of projects and all. Seeing how others use it.
    2. His code is quite optimised.
        1. I know that I don’t need to write the cleanest code in the first attempt.
            1. But I do need to optimise the already written code.
14. The error is due to caching issues.
